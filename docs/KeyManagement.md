# Key Management  🗝️

The end-user of a dApp is provided with encryption keys when they interact with a secret contract. 

TODO

 - Where are the keys stored 
 - How can users access the keys
 - When might a user need to access the keys
 - What enigma-js functions are related to user's key-management?
 - What kind of keys are they / what are their features?
 - This enables private outputs.
