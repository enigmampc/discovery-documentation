# Secret Contracts 🤫

[Secret contracts](Glossary.md) are self-executing contracts with encrypted inputs and outputs. Once deployed on the Enigma network, they are called by the end-users of decentralized applications and executed by Enigma nodes.

Enigma Secret Contracts are written in Rust. If you are not familiar with Rust, check out our walkthrough (which will also take you through developing your first Secret Contract). 

**We highly encourage the [walkthrough](SecretContractWalkthrough.md) for first-time users.** 🤞
