# Why Rust? ⚙️
Rust is an excellent programming language that simultaneously optimizes for both safety and performance in a way few languages can claim. The Rust core team has created a language that allows for veteran developers and newcomers alike to develop production-ready, systems-level code.
## Performance 🏎️
Rust features a unique and powerful combination of the [cargo package manager](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2016/05/05/cargo-pillars.html) (overlooked in higher level languages), [zero-cost abstractions](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/05/11/traits.html), [memory management](https://pcwalton.github.io/2013/03/18/an-overview-of-memory-management-in-rust.html) that is both manual and smart in nature (thereby avoiding both the runtime garbage collection costs you find in Python and Ruby as well as the error-prone nature of manual management in C and C++), and many other features.
## Safety 👷
The strict compilation checks and error explanations Rust offers prevent large classes of common errors, supporting safe and performant code.
## Community 🧑‍🤝‍🧑
Last, but certainly not least, there is a wonderful community of Rustaceans (a weird, but endearing term that will grow on you over time) that will support whatever your journey may be. Joining this community puts you in good company — as one [recent survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-languages) shows, Rust has been voted the most loved programming language for the third year in a row!
