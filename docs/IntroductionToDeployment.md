# Deploying the Enigma Network  📡

Discovery can currently be deployed in two ways: 

1. **Developer Mode**:  a series of containers in a Docker environment. This is also known as "Simulation Mode" because it does not require you to have hardware SGX support (meaning yes, you can develop on your macbook!). 
2. **Hardware Mode**: This mode requires hardware-level compatibility (see "System Requirements"). This is useful for users who may want to run Secret Nodes. 

**For a step-by-step walkthrough of the "developer mode" deployment process, see our Getting Started guide.** 

🤞Discovery will be also soon deployed to a public Ethereum testnet, giving you the opportunity to test your applications in the wild on a network of nodes, and streamlining your development options. Stay tuned! 📺
