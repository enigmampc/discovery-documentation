# Enigma Network Architecture 🤝

Enigma and Ethereum work together, and separate computation and storage from consensus. 

## Enigma: Compute and Storage Layer 

 - **Secret Contract Engine**: Executes computations.
 - **Peer-to-peer Network**: Propagates messages in the Enigma network.
 - **State Management**: Stores and manages the state.
 - **Key Management**: Stores and manages encryption, decryption and signing keys.
 

## Ethereum: Consensus Layer 
 -   **Shared Ledger**: Stores the worker registry, task records and proofs of completed tasks.
 - **Consensus**: Agreement on task order and confirmation status.
