# Developer Mode 💻

Developer mode (also known as Simulation mode) enables local deployment and testing of the Enigma Network as a series of Docker containers. This is the development mode we recommend for application developers writing secret contracts. 

While it is possible to deploy the network in "hardware mode", we recommend this for node runners.
